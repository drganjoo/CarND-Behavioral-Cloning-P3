# Behavioral Cloning 

**Goals Of the Project**

* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
* Summarize the results with a written report

## Rubric Points

My project includes the following files:
* model.py containing the script to create and train the model. It used keras **v2.0.3** functional API 
* generator.py containing the script to generate data
* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode
* model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network 
* writeup_report.md summarizing the results

Using the Udacity provided simulator and my drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the first track by executing 
```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

*Note: It is not able to drive above 20 mph*

## Model Architecture and Training Strategy

I've used more or less **NVidia's model** for self driving (https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/)

The changes to the model include **dropout** layers in **fully connected** layers.

The following is the summary of the model:

Total params: **10,088,055**

#### Reduction of Overfitting

* More data was gathered to reduce overfitting:
    * **Simple runs** on the track to keep car in center
    * **Drove in Opposite Direction** to ensure there were some right turns
    * **Extreme steering angles** by keeping the car on the right most or left most side and then steering it back to the center

* The model contains **dropout layers** in order to reduce overfitting (model.py lines 47-51). 

 
#### Model parameter tuning

The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (model.py line 56).

#### Appropriate training data

Sample-data provided by Udacity was used along with data generated by driving myself. Drove the car in the opposite direction on the track to make sure right turns were also included in the data.

Then generated smaller multiple runs of extreme turns from the extreme edges of the road. But I think this is also the cause of a little over steering by the car.

Also data generated by myself needs to be further checked since at times the car does not maintain steering angle while turning but rather issues a series of jerky steering angles, each time coming back to 0. I would have liked it to maintain a smaller turning angle throughout the turn.

For details about how I created the training data, see the next section. 

### **Model Architecture and Training Strategy**

#### 1. Solution Design Approach

The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to have a few convolutional layers for feature extraction followed by some fully connected layers having a few dropouts to reduce overfitting (in case that happened).

My first step was to use a convolution neural network model similar to the NVidia model as I thought this model might be appropriate due to their success in using it in real life.

My initial runs was not turning at all thats when I realized that using the keyboard I wasn't able to maintain a steady angle throughout the turn therefore **bad data -> bad learning** happened. I then used mouse / joystick to make sure I drove around the circuit as much in the center as I could.

I generated a histogram to figure out the kind of data I had:

| Steering Angle | Number of Data points | % 
|------|---|--------|
|-1.00 | 4| 0.050 % |
|-0.90 | 1| 0.012 % |
|-0.80 | 2| 0.025 % |
|-0.70 | 6| 0.075 % |
|-0.60 | 11| 0.137 % |
|-0.50 | 62| 0.772 % |
|-0.40 | 78| 0.971 % |
|-0.30 | 300| 3.733 % |
|-0.20 | 473| 5.886 % |
|**-0.10** | **838** | **10.428** % |
|**0.00** | **5085**| **63.278** % |
|**0.10** | **781**| **9.719** % |
|0.20 | 161| 2.003 % |
|0.30 | 172| 2.140 % |
|0.40 | 42| 0.523 % |
|0.50 | 12| 0.149 % |
|0.60 | 5| 0.062 % |
|0.70 | 1| 0.012 % |
|0.80 | 0| 0.000 % |
|0.90 | 2| 0.025 % |

The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. There were a few spots where the vehicle fell off the track... to improve the driving behavior in these cases, I ....

At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.

#### 2. Final Model Architecture

The final model architecture (model.py lines 18-24) consisted of a convolution neural network with the following layers and layer sizes ...

Here is a visualization of the architecture (note: visualizing the architecture is optional according to the project rubric)

####3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process

mention keras callbacks

To capture good driving behavior, I first recorded two laps on track one using center lane driving. Here is an example image of center lane driving:

![alt text][image2]

I then recorded the vehicle recovering from the left side and right sides of the road back to center so that the vehicle would learn to .... These images show what a recovery looks like starting from ... :

Then I repeated this process on track two in order to get more data points.

To augment the data sat, I also flipped images and angles thinking that this would ... For example, here is an image that has then been flipped:

![alt text][image7]

Etc ....

After the collection process, I had X number of data points. I then preprocessed this data by ...


I finally randomly shuffled the data set and put Y% of the data into a validation set. 

I used this training data for training the model. The validation set helped determine if the model was over or under fitting. The ideal number of epochs was Z as evidenced by ... I used an adam optimizer so that manually training the learning rate wasn't necessary.
