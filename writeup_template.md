# Behavioral Cloning 

**Goals Of the Project**

* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
* Summarize the results with a written report

## Rubric Points

My project includes the following files:
* model.py containing the script to create and train the model
* generator.py containing the script to generate data
* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode
* model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network 
* writeup_report.md summarizing the results

Using the Udacity provided simulator and my drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the first track by executing 
```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

*Note: It is not able to drive above 20 mph*

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

[ModelArchitecture] ./writeup/tb-graphpng

I've used more or less NVidia's model for self driving (https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/)

The changes to the model include dropout layers in fully connected layers.

The following is the summary generated by keras.model.summary():

####2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model

The model contains dropout layers in order to reduce overfitting (model.py lines 54-58). 

More data was gathered to reduce overfitting. Drove the car in reverse on the track to make sure
 it had some right turns as well. 
 
####3. Model parameter tuning

The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (model.py line 63).

####4. Appropriate training data

Sample-data provided by Udacity was used along with data generated by driving myself. Drove the car
in the opposite direction on the track to make sure right turns were also included in the data.

Then generated smaller multiple runs of extreme turns from the edge of the road. But I think this is 
also the cause of a little over steering by the car.

Also data generated by myself needs to be further checked since at times the car does not maintain steering
angle while turning but rather issues a series of big steering angles, each time coming back to 0. I would
 have liked it to maintain a smaller running angle.

For details about how I created the training data, see the next section. 

###Model Architecture and Training Strategy

####1. Solution Design Approach

The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to ...

My first step was to use a convolution neural network model similar to the ... I thought this model might be appropriate because ...

In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set. I found that my first model had a low mean squared error on the training set but a high mean squared error on the validation set. This implied that the model was overfitting. 

To combat the overfitting, I modified the model so that ...

Then I ... 

The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. There were a few spots where the vehicle fell off the track... to improve the driving behavior in these cases, I ....

At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.

####2. Final Model Architecture

The final model architecture (model.py lines 18-24) consisted of a convolution neural network with the following layers and layer sizes ...

Here is a visualization of the architecture (note: visualizing the architecture is optional according to the project rubric)

####3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process

To capture good driving behavior, I first recorded two laps on track one using center lane driving. Here is an example image of center lane driving:

![alt text][image2]

I then recorded the vehicle recovering from the left side and right sides of the road back to center so that the vehicle would learn to .... These images show what a recovery looks like starting from ... :

![alt text][image3]
![alt text][image4]
![alt text][image5]

Then I repeated this process on track two in order to get more data points.

To augment the data sat, I also flipped images and angles thinking that this would ... For example, here is an image that has then been flipped:

![alt text][image6]
![alt text][image7]

Etc ....

After the collection process, I had X number of data points. I then preprocessed this data by ...


I finally randomly shuffled the data set and put Y% of the data into a validation set. 

I used this training data for training the model. The validation set helped determine if the model was over or under fitting. The ideal number of epochs was Z as evidenced by ... I used an adam optimizer so that manually training the learning rate wasn't necessary.
